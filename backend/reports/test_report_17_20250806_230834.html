DASHBOARD_ELEMENT = "div.dashboard-header"
USERNAME_SELECTOR = "input[name='username']"
PASSWORD_SELECTOR = "input[name='password']"
LOGIN_BUTTON_SELECTOR = "button[type='submit']"
ERROR_MESSAGE_SELECTOR = "div.error-message"

# Test credentials
VALID_USERNAME = "validuser"
VALID_PASSWORD = "validpassword"
INVALID_USERNAME = "invaliduser"
